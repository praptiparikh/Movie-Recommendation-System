# Movie-Recommendation-System
This Python program allows users to search for movies from a CSV file (Movies_data.csv) using two methods:

Search by Movie Name – The program finds movies whose titles match the user’s input and also suggests other movies from the same genre.

Search by Genre – The program lists all movies that belong to the genre entered by the user.

It uses Pandas to read and filter movie data and runs in a loop so users can perform multiple searches until they choose to stop.
